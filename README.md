# Karabiner Actions

Thanks to the original work in <https://github.com/Erlendms/karabiner-actions>, I had an incredible starting place to implement home row mods on a built-in keyboard (and replace buggy HRM in QMK).

I plan to add additional functionality, but as a first-pass, this fork implements the GACS variant of HRM and is configurable to any order.

Quick Start

```sh
# Install Node (brew, asdf, mise, nvm, etc.)
mise install

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Apply changes from config
npm run build
```
