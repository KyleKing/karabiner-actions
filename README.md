# Karabiner Actions

Home Row Mods (HRM) are adapted from: <https://github.com/Erlendms/karabiner-actions>. Implemented as GACS, but easily configurable for other orders

The layers were inspired by: <https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html#a-reasonable-default>

Keyboard practice is with <https://monkeytype.com> using *Quote* and *Python* to practice with symbols

## Quick Start

```sh
# Install Node (alternatively with brew, asdf, nvm, apt-get, etc.)
mise install

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Apply changes from config
npm run build
```
